# HTML output

The final stage of indexing is to output an HTML file for every source
file. This code lives in `tools/src/bin/output.rs`. The main
formatting loop is in `tools/src/format.rs`. The inputs to this
process are:

* The original source code, either from the file system (for the
  current version) or from version control (for historical versions).
* Blame information from the blame repository.
* Analysis records generated for the given file.
* Jump information generated by the cross referencer.

The original code is tokenized using one of two hand-coded tokenizers
(both in `tools/src/tokenize.rs`). One tokenizer recognizes C-like
languages (JS, C++, IDL, Python) and the other recognizes tag-based
languages (HTML, XML).

The central loop in `format.rs` iterates over tokens.  When it finds
an identifier token, it outputs markup for all text between the
previous identifier and this one. Then it checks if this identifier
has an analysis source record for the token's location. If it does,
then it adds `data-` attributes to the markup that describe what the
context menu should do for that identifier. Regardless, the markup
colors the identifier based on whether it's a reserved word as well as
the `syntax` property on the source record (if there is one).

### Blame diffs

The output code also has the ability to show annotated commit
diffs. These diffs are generated dynamically by the web server when
the user requests an annotated diff. The diff is generated by running
`git diff -U100000`. All the lines forming the "new" version of the
file are also run through `format.rs` to syntax highlight them
(although there are no analysis records available). The "old" `-`
lines are then merged in at the right locations and the appropriate
blame information is fetched for unchanged and `-` lines.
